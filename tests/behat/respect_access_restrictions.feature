  @javascript
  Scenario: Confirm monitor for unrestricted activity shows all students
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the live monitor report for "Quiz-1"
    Then I should see "Student One"
    And I should see "Student Two"
    And I should see "Student Three"
    And I should see "Student Four"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Confirm group access restrictions filter students
    # Set activity access restriction directly on quiz editing page
    Given I am on the "Quiz-1" "quiz activity editing" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I click on "Group" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    And I set the field "Group" in the "Restrict access" "fieldset" to "Group-12"
    And I press "Save and display"

    # Confirm Live Monitor immediately filters out non-group members
    When I am on the live monitor report for "Quiz-1"
    Then I should see "Student One"
    And I should see "Student Two"
    And I should not see "Student Three"
    And I should not see "Student Four"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Group membership changes update the monitor automatically without reload
    # Set activity access restriction directly on quiz editing page
    Given I am on the "Quiz-1" "quiz activity editing" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I click on "Group" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    And I set the field "Group" in the "Restrict access" "fieldset" to "Group-12"
    And I press "Save and return to course"

    When I am on the live monitor report for "Quiz-1"
    Then I should see "Student One"
    And I should see "Student Two"
    And I should not see "Student Three"
    And I should not see "Student Four"

    # Add Student Three to the restricted group and confirm they appear in the monitor.
    When user "student3" is added to group "Group-12"
    And I wait "6" seconds
    Then I should see "Student Three"

    # Remove Student One from the restricted group and confirm they disappear from the monitor.
    When user "student1" is removed from group "Group-12"
    And I wait "6" seconds
    Then I should not see "Student One"
