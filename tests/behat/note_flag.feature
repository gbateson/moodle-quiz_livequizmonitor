      | SA1      | 1    |
    And I log in as "teacher1"

  @javascript
  Scenario: No note flag is shown before a note exists
    Given I am on the live monitor report for "Quiz 1"
    Then I should see "Sam Student"
    And ".livequizmonitor-note-flag" "css_element" should not exist

  @javascript
  Scenario: A note flag appears next to the student's name after a note is saved
    Given I am on the live monitor report for "Quiz 1"
    And ".livequizmonitor-note-flag" "css_element" should not exist
    And I click on ".livequizmonitor-row-actions .dropdown-toggle" "css_element"
    And I click on "Add note" "link"
    And I set the field "Add a supervision note for this student." to "Requested bathroom break"
    When I click on "Save" "button"
    Then "[data-field='fullname'] .livequizmonitor-note-flag" "css_element" should exist
    And "[title='This student has a note']" "css_element" should exist

  @javascript
  Scenario: The note flag disappears once the note is cleared
    Given I am on the live monitor report for "Quiz 1"
    And I click on ".livequizmonitor-row-actions .dropdown-toggle" "css_element"
    And I click on "Add note" "link"
    And I set the field "Add a supervision note for this student." to "Requested bathroom break"
    And I click on "Save" "button"
    And "[data-field='fullname'] .livequizmonitor-note-flag" "css_element" should exist

    When I click on ".livequizmonitor-row-actions .dropdown-toggle" "css_element"
    And I click on "Edit note" "link"
    And I set the field "Add a supervision note for this student." to ""
    And I click on "Save" "button"
    And I wait "6" seconds
    Then ".livequizmonitor-note-flag" "css_element" should not exist
